# California House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict median house prices in California using the **California Housing Dataset** from `scikit-learn`. It demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline: data preprocessing, modeling, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization.

## Files Included

- `california-housing-prediction.ipynb` â†’ Main notebook
- `images/` â†’ Contains generated plots
- `README.md`, `requirements.txt` â†’ Documentation and dependencies


## Problem Statement

Given features like median income, average rooms, location, and occupancy, predict the **median house value** for California districts.

---

## Workflow

- Load and inspect the dataset
- Preprocess data using `MinMaxScaler`
- Train baseline **Linear Regression**
- Tune and train **Random Forest Regressor**
- Evaluate using **MSE, RÂ² Score, MAE**
- Visualize feature importance and residuals

---

## Results

| Model              | RÂ² Score | MAE     |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| Linear Regression | ~0.57    | ~$53,000 |
| Random Forest     | ~0.81    | ~$33,000 |

Random Forest performed significantly better after tuning, reducing prediction error by ~38%.
